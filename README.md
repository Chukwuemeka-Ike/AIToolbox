# AIToolbox
This is a toolbox containing functions and scripts I've written 
implementing a growing number of AI and ML algorithms. 

It's mainly here to help me and anyone who might be looking for no-frills, 
easy to read, code implementing any of the algorithms.

I will keep an updated list of the algorithms present and strive to be 
as informative as possible. 

Note: The implementations may only be available in one of the following 
languages:
1. MATLAB
2. Python
3. C++

## Current Algorithms
1. Extreme Learning Machine
2. AutoEncoder

## Scripts
1. autoEncoders.m
2. extremeLearningMachines.mlx

## Helper Function Scripts (Mostly MATLAB)
1. accuracy
